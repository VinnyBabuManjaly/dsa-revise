    "There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n",

    "Main Logic:\n",
    "- Start from the bottom-right of the grid where only one path exists.\n",
    "- Use a 1D array to represent the number of paths for the current row.\n",
    "- Initialize all cells in the last row as 1 since there is only one way to move right.\n",
    "- Move row by row upward.\n",
    "- For each cell, calculate paths as the sum of paths from the right cell and the cell below.\n",
    "- Update the row after finishing each iteration.\n",
    "- The top-left cell finally contains the total number of unique paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "Each cell’s paths depend only on the cell to the right and the cell below, so we reuse a single row to save space."
