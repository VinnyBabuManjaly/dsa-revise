    "The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:   \n",
    "arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.   \n",
    "arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.   \n",

    "**Approach**: Two-Heaps Balancing (Max-Heap + Min-Heap)\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain two heaps:\n",
    "    * low (max-heap) → stores the smaller half of numbers.\n",
    "    * high (min-heap) → stores the larger half of numbers.\n",
    "- Always push new numbers into low first (as negative values to simulate max-heap).\n",
    "- If the largest value in low becomes greater than the smallest in high, move it to high to maintain ordering.\n",
    "- Rebalance:\n",
    "    * If low becomes more than 1 element larger than high, move top of low → high.\n",
    "    * If high becomes larger than low, move top of high → low.\n",
    "- Median:\n",
    "    * If both heaps same size → average of both heap tops.\n",
    "    * Otherwise → top of low (because it will always have 1 extra when odd count).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the numbers into two halves, keep them balanced, and ensure all values in low ≤ all values in high.\n",
    "This guarantees that the median is always at the top(s) of the heaps."
