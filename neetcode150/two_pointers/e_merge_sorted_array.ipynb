    "# Merge Sorted Array\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.  \n",
    "The task is to merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead stored inside nums1. To make this possible, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements are the actual values to be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:  \n",
    "Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3  \n",
    "Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6] \n",
    "Explanation: The arrays being merged are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6]. The result of merging is [1,2,2,3,5,6].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0  \n",
    "Output: [1]  \n",
    "Explanation: The arrays being merged are [1] and []. The result of merging is [1].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:  \n",
    "Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1  \n",
    "Output: [1]  \n",
    "Explanation: The arrays being merged are [] and [1]. The result of merging is [1]. Since m = 0, nums1 initially has no valid elements. The 0 is only there as a placeholder to fit the merged result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:  \n",
    "nums1.length == m + n  \n",
    "nums2.length == n  \n",
    "0 <= m, n <= 200  \n",
    "1 <= m + n <= 200  \n",
