    "Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).\n",

    "The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).   \n",
    "The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).   \n",
    "Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.   \n",
    "We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].   \n",
