    "Main Logic:\n",
    "- Treat the top of the stairs as an extra step with zero cost.\n",
    "- Start from the end of the cost list and move backward.\n",
    "- At each step, add the minimum cost of the next one or two steps.\n",
    "- This updates the cost array to store the minimum cost to reach the top from that step.\n",
    "- At the end, choose the minimum cost from the first or second step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "The minimum cost to reach the top from a step depends only on the next two steps, so we can reuse the input array."
