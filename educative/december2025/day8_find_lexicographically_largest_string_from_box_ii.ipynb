    "[Find the Lexicographically Largest String From Box II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-lexicographically-largest-string-from-the-box-ii/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string `word` and an integer `numFriends`, the number of friends participating in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Game rules (per round):\n",
    "- The string `word` is split into exactly `numFriends` non-empty substrings.\n",
    "- Each round must use a split that has not been used in any previous round (i.e., each ordered sequence of cut positions can be used only once).\n",
    "- All substrings resulting from the split are placed into a box.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing all possible unique splits (i.e., every distinct way to split `word` into `numFriends` non-empty parts), consider every substring that has been placed into the box across all rounds. Your task is to determine the lexicographically largest string among all substrings in that box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicographic order definition used here:\n",
    "- Compare characters from left to right; the string whose character is later in the alphabet at the first differing position is larger.\n",
    "- If one string is a prefix of the other, the longer string is considered larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Splits are ordered: splitting into parts [a, b, c] is different from [a, bc] etc., but we always produce exactly `numFriends` parts; equivalently, you choose `numFriends - 1` cut positions among the `word.length - 1` possible cut positions.\n",
    "- Collect every substring produced by every valid split; then find the lexicographically largest among all collected substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- 1 ≤ word.length ≤ 10^3\n",
    "- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- 1 ≤ numFriends ≤ word.length\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "word = \"dabc\", numFriends = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "All splits into exactly 2 non-empty parts:\n",
    "1) [\"d\", \"abc\"]  → substrings: \"d\", \"abc\"\n",
    "2) [\"da\", \"bc\"]  → substrings: \"da\", \"bc\"\n",
    "3) [\"dab\", \"c\"]  → substrings: \"dab\", \"c\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Box contents: {\"d\", \"abc\", \"da\", \"bc\", \"dab\", \"c\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicographically largest string in the box: \"dab\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \"dab\""
