    "\n",
    "Insight: Always pick the character with the highest remaining count, unless it would create three in a row, in which case temporarily switch to the next-best character. After using a character, push it back with an updated remaining count so the choice stays fair and balanced across a, b, and c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tricky Part: The main care point is handling the “three in a row” situation correctly—when the top character would violate the rule, it must be skipped for that step, and if no other character is available at that moment, the string is complete and the process stops.\n",
