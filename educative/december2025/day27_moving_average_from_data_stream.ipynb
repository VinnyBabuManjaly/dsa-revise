    "Core Idea: Maintain a running sum over a fixed-size window\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pattern: Queue-backed sliding window\n",
    "Keep the last N values in a queue and maintain their running sum. Each new value is added to the queue and the sum, and when the window is full, the oldest value is removed and subtracted from the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Works Here:\n",
    "The moving average can be updated in constant time by adjusting the sum incrementally instead of recomputing it over the entire window each time. This makes the structure efficient even for long-running streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Lesson:\n",
    "This is the same pattern used in lightweight monitoring and rate calculations—CPU load averages, rolling error rates, or moving metrics can all be tracked with a small buffer and an incremental update instead of full recomputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Worth Remembering:\n",
    "When the stream has fewer values than the window size, the average is taken over the actual count in the buffer, not the configured window size."
