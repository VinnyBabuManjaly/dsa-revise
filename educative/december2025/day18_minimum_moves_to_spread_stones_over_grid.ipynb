    "Approach: Assign extra stones to empty cells with minimal total distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: The grid has exactly nine stones and nine cells, so the task becomes matching “extra” stones (cells with more than one) to “empty” cells (value zero). The idea is to list all extra-stone positions and all empty positions, then explore all ways of pairing them and pick the assignment with the smallest total number of steps, where each step is a move to a side-adjacent cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tricky Part: The subtle part is tracking which empty cells have already been assigned while exploring different pairings, so the same target cell is not used twice. This small bookkeeping detail makes the search correct and keeps the total move count truly minimal."
