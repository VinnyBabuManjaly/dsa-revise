    "Core Idea: Locate a target in a sorted array in logarithmic time\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pattern: Repeated halving of the search interval\n",
    "Keep two pointers on the current search range (left and right), check the middle element, and then discard the half where the target cannot exist. Repeat until the target is found or the range is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Works Here:\n",
    "The array is sorted, so every comparison against the middle element cleanly splits the search space into “too small” and “too big.” This turns a linear scan into a much faster logarithmic search, which scales well as input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Lesson:\n",
    "This pattern underpins many real systems like index lookups, search services, pagination, and configuration ranges all benefit from narrowing down options by ordered comparisons instead of scanning everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Worth Remembering:\n",
    "The loop condition and mid calculation matter, updating the pointers correctly avoids infinite loops and off‑by‑one errors, especially near the boundaries."
