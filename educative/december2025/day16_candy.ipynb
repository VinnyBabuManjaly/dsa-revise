    "Approach: Two-pass greedy from left and right\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: Started by assigning 1 candy to every child, then walked left to right to ensure each child with a higher rating than the left neighbor received more candies. A second pass from right to left then corrected cases where a child also needed more candies than the right neighbor, taking the maximum from both passes to keep the allocation minimal yet consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tricky Part: The key detail is that a child’s final candy count can be constrained by both sides; relying on a single pass biases the solution toward one direction and breaks the rules around local peaks, while the symmetric second pass balances things without over-distributing."
