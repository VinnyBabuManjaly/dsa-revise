    "The Pattern: Unbounded coin-change over all perfect squares\n",
    "Precompute all perfect squares up to n, then for every value from 1 to n, choose the best way to form it by adding one square on top of a previously solved smaller value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Works Here:\n",
    "Each number up to n can be seen as “current square + a smaller remainder already solved.” Reusing these smaller results avoids recomputing combinations and guarantees the minimal count of squares for every value up to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Lesson:\n",
    "This pattern matches many real workloads where a target cost, latency, or capacity is assembled from reusable building blocks—solve smaller subproblems once, cache them, and scale the result instead of recomputing from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Worth Remembering:\n",
    "Initializing the base case correctly (0 requires 0 squares) and skipping squares larger than the current target keeps the transitions simple and the solution efficient."
