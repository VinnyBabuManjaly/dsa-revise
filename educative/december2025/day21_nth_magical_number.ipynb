    "Approach: Binary search on the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: Instead of listing all numbers divisible by a or b, searched directly on the number line. For a given candidate value, counted how many numbers up to that value are divisible by a or b, adjusting for overlap using their common multiples. Then narrowed the range until landing exactly on the position where the count first reaches n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tricky Part: The main care point is correctly handling the overlap between multiples of a and b so they are not double-counted, and keeping the search bounds tight and safe for large n. The final result is taken modulo 1e9+7, as required by the problem."
