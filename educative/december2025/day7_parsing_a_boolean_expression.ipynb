    "\n",
    "'t' evaluates to true\n",
    "'f' evaluates to false\n",
    "'!(subExpr)' evaluates to the logical NOT of subExpr\n",

    "Insight: Scanned the expression character by character, pushing tokens onto a stack. Whenever a closing parenthesis appeared, popped the inner values, applied the current operator (&, |, or !) to those t/f values, and pushed a single result back. Repeating this reduced the whole nested expression down to one final truth value.\n",
