    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the ith flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive to see the flowers.\n",

    "Core Idea: Count active intervals at each query time\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pattern: Sort starts and ends, then use binary search\n",
    "All flower start times are sorted in one list and all end times in another. For each person’s arrival time, the count of flowers in bloom is the number that have already started minus the number that have already finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Works Here:\n",
    "Sorting once allows each query to be answered in logarithmic time by asking two simple questions: “How many flowers have opened so far?” and “How many have already closed?” The difference gives the exact number in bloom at that moment, without scanning all intervals again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Lesson:\n",
    "This pattern mirrors time-based analytics in real systems, active sessions, running jobs, or live feature flags can often be tracked by separately sorting start and end timestamps and answering “how many are active now?” with two fast lookups instead of a full scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Worth Remembering:\n",
    "The strictness of the comparison matters: starts use “less than or equal to” the time, while ends use “strictly less than” the time, so flowers are counted as blooming throughout their entire inclusive interval."
