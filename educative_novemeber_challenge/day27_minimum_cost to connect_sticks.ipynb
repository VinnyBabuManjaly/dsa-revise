    "You are given an array sticks where sticks[i] is the length of the ith stick. You can connect any two sticks of lengths x and y into one stick by paying a cost of x + y. You must repeat this process until there is only one stick left. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to connect all the sticks.  \n",
